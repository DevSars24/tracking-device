Sun Tracker ðŸŒž



A sleek, real-time location tracking web application built to showcase my full-stack development skills. Sun Tracker displays your current location on an interactive map with a high-resolution zoom, wrapped in a futuristic blue-purple neon UI. The top-left corner features a typewriter-style animation proudly declaring: "Made by Saurabh Singh Rajput, Self-Taught Programmer Coder". This project is a testament to my journey as a self-taught developer, blending functionality with a visually stunning interface.
